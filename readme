Synopsis:
Given a partially filled 9×9 2D array ‘grid[9][9]’, the goal is to assign digits (from 1 to 9) to the empty cells so that 
every row, column, and subgrid of size 3×3 contains exactly one instance of the digits from 1 to 9.

Backtracking Algorithm
Like all other Backtracking problems, we can solve Sudoku by one by one assigning numbers to empty cells. Before assigning a number,
we check whether it is safe to assign. We basically check that the same number is not present in the current row, current column 
and current 3X3 subgrid. After checking for safety, we assign the number, and recursively check whether this assignment leads to a 
solution or not. If the assignment doesn’t lead to a solution, then we try next number for the current empty cell. And if none of 
the number (1 to 9) leads to a solution, we return false.
